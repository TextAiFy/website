TextAiFy: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Policy Khata App!

This is an open source Android app developed by Sandesh Apps. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have programmed this app to collect personally identifiable information like email and name. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and data) created by the you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
